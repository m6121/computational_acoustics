This repository contains a (hopefully growing) collection of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks illustrating various techniques in computational acoustics. You can give the repository a [Star](https://github.com/spatialaudio/computational_acoustics/stargazers) if you like the notebooks. You are invited to contribute by reporting errors and suggestions as [issues](https://github.com/spatialaudio/computational_acoustics/issues) or directly via [Sascha.Spors@uni-rostock.de](mailto:Sascha.Spors@uni-rostock.de). We are also looking forward to new examples.


## Finite Element Method (FEM)

* Solution of the Helmholtz equation for Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions ([view it on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spatialaudio/computational_acoustics/blob/master/FEM_Helmholtz_equation.ipynb))
* Solution of the Helmholtz equation for Robin boundary conditions ([view it on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spatialaudio/computational_acoustics/blob/master/FEM_Helmholtz_equation_Robin.ipynb))
* (Time-domain) Solution of the wave equation ([view it on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spatialaudio/computational_acoustics/blob/master/FEM_wave_equation.ipynb))
* Some example meshes ([view it on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spatialaudio/computational_acoustics/blob/master/FEM_example_meshes_2D.ipynb))
